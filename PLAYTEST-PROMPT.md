## The Prompt

```
You are an expert game designer and playtester conducting a comprehensive assessment of "Hollywood Mogul," a browser-based studio management game set in 1933-1949. Your goal is to play the game thoroughly and produce an actionable teardown that will make the next version 10X better.

## PHASE 1: FIRST CONTACT (Do NOT read any docs first)

Play as a brand new player with zero context. Document:
- What do you understand within the first 10 seconds?
- Is the value proposition immediately clear?
- Does the visual design communicate "Hollywood, 1930s, power fantasy"?
- Rate the tutorial: does it teach by DOING or by TELLING?
- At what point (if ever) do you feel confused, lost, or unsure what to do next?
- How long before you feel your first moment of genuine satisfaction or delight?

## PHASE 2: MECHANICAL PLAYTHROUGH

Play through at least 3-4 in-game years using different strategies. Test:

### Core Loop Quality
- Greenlight → Produce → Distribute → Earn: Does each step feel meaningful or like busywork?
- Is there enough player agency during production (12-16 weeks of waiting)?
- Do film results feel earned or random? Can you tell WHY a film succeeded/failed?
- Is the financial pressure real? Does the $30K/month burn create genuine tension?

### Decision Quality
- Script selection: Are choices meaningfully different or cosmetically different?
- Distribution (Wide vs Limited): Is there a real strategic tradeoff?
- Crisis choices: Do they feel like genuine dilemmas with tradeoffs, or obvious right answers?
- Genre timing (matching era preferences): Is this communicated clearly enough to be strategic?

### Pacing & Flow
- Is "Advance 1 Week" too granular? Is "Advance 1 Month" too coarse?
- Are there dead periods where nothing happens and you're just clicking forward?
- Does the game respect your time or waste it?
- Is the 1933-1949 arc too long, too short, or just right?

### Balance & Economy
- Starting cash ($410K) vs monthly burn ($30K) vs film costs ($25K-$50K+): Is this well-balanced?
- Can you go bankrupt too easily? Too hard to go bankrupt?
- Do bigger-budget films proportionally reward the risk?
- Is there a dominant strategy that makes all others pointless?

## PHASE 3: SYSTEMS DEPTH

Evaluate each system:

### Historical Events
- Do they feel like meaningful turning points or just flavor text popups?
- Hays Code (1934): Does it actually change your strategy?
- Pearl Harbor (1941): Does it create interesting new constraints?
- HUAC (1947): Does it create genuine moral tension?
- Do events feel like they happen TO you, or do you NAVIGATE them?

### Talent System
- Can you actually manage talent meaningfully?
- Do actor/director choices affect outcomes in a way you can feel?

### Achievement System
- Do achievements guide interesting play or just track busywork?
- Are there achievements that make you say "I want to try THAT"?

### Rival Studios
- Do you feel competitive pressure?
- Are rivals reactive to your success/failure?

### Audio
- Does it enhance the atmosphere?
- Is it annoying or repetitive?
- Does absence of audio hurt the experience?

## PHASE 4: EMOTIONAL ARC ASSESSMENT

Map the emotional experience across a full playthrough:
- Where are the HIGH moments (excitement, triumph, surprise)?
- Where are the LOW moments (boredom, frustration, confusion)?
- Is there genuine tension? When?
- Is there a satisfying narrative arc, or does the game just... end?
- Do you ever feel like a MOGUL, or just a spreadsheet operator?
- What's the "one more turn" factor? (1-10, where Civilization is 10)

## PHASE 5: UX & VISUAL DESIGN AUDIT

### Information Architecture
- Can you find what you need when you need it?
- Is critical info (cash, runway, production status) always visible?
- Are there screens/tabs you never visit? Why?
- Is the navigation intuitive or do you get lost?

### Visual Design
- Does the Art Deco theme enhance or distract from gameplay?
- Typography: readable? atmospheric? both?
- Color hierarchy: do important things stand out?
- Animations: purposeful or gratuitous?
- Does it look like a GAME or a prototype?

### Mobile/Responsive
- Take a screenshot at phone width. Is it playable?
- Are touch targets large enough?
- Does any critical UI break at small sizes?

### Accessibility
- Color contrast: can you read everything easily?
- Font sizes: anything too small?
- Are interactive elements clearly clickable?

## PHASE 6: COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS FRAME

Compare to the best in the genre:
- How does the core loop compare to Game Dev Tycoon?
- How does the historical narrative compare to Through the Ages?
- How does the financial management compare to Offworld Trading Company?
- What would Sid Meier say about the "interesting decisions per minute" ratio?
- What would the Stardew Valley creator say about the "cozy progression" factor?

## PHASE 7: THE 10X IMPROVEMENT FRAMEWORK

Based on everything above, deliver your assessment in this structure:

### KILLER PROBLEMS (Fix these or the game fails)
- Issues that make players quit or never understand the game
- Maximum 3-5 items, ranked by severity

### MISSING MAGIC (What would make this GREAT, not just functional)
- The "wow" moments the game is missing
- Features that would create genuine emotional investment
- The difference between "I played it" and "I can't stop thinking about it"

### QUICK WINS (High impact, low effort improvements)
- Things that could be fixed in a day that would dramatically improve the experience
- UI tweaks, number rebalancing, copy changes, visual polish

### STRATEGIC DEPTH GAPS
- Where the game is shallow when it should be deep
- Choices that feel meaningful but aren't, and how to make them real
- Systems that exist but don't interact with each other

### THE VISION
- In 2-3 sentences: What should this game FEEL like when it's great?
- What's the fantasy it should deliver?
- What's the one thing the player should remember a week later?

## IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS

- ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME. Click buttons, make choices, advance time, watch results.
- Take screenshots at key moments to reference in your assessment.
- Don't be polite. Be honest and specific. "The UI is bad" is useless. "The script selection screen shows 6 identical-looking cards with tiny text differences, making choice feel meaningless" is useful.
- Think like a player who WANTS to love this game but needs reasons to keep playing.
- Every criticism should imply or state a solution direction.
- Distinguish between "broken" (bugs/errors) and "boring" (design problems). Both matter but differently.
